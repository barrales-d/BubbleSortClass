## My personal Project
Working on how to learn and understand different algorithms through just researching. 

Attempting to not copy code that I find online and coding the algorithm myself. 

Making use of object-oriented code.

Three main files that I created: main.cpp, BubbleSort.cpp, BubbleSort.h
